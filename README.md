## 📌 Project Overview

### 🔬 Background
- Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) often assumes a fixed protein conformation, limiting its accuracy in identifying potential ligands.
- This study investigates how incorporating multiple protein and ligand conformations improves SBVS accuracy.
- Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to generate a diverse set of conformations for HIV-1 protease and its ligands.
- Force field-based energy calculations were conducted to evaluate binding free energies.

### 🛠 Methods
1. **Molecular Dynamics Simulations**: Conducted MD simulations for protein-ligand complexes, apo proteins, and ligands.
2. **Superimposition**: Aligned protein and ligand structures to ensure structural consistency.
3. **Clustering**: Used RMSD-based clustering to reduce redundant conformations while preserving structural diversity.
4. **Force Field Preparation**: Generated force field parameters for interaction energy calculations.
5. **Energy Calculations**: Computed electrostatic (Eele) and van der Waals (Evdw) interaction energies.
